# Super Bomber Bros

The humble beginning of a game using [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) where Mario and Bomberman collide!

## Installation

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org), which is used to pack and build some of the graphics and sounds.

Install FFmpeg with a package installer of your choice. For Windows users, try these instructions:
[Install FFmpeg on Windows](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows).
Here's an example using [brew](https://brew.sh) on macOS:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

Using [git](https://git-scm.com), clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshuacurtiss/super-bomber-bros.git
```

Install dependencies and run the development server:
```bash
cd super-bomber-bros
npm install
npm start
```

Enjoy!
